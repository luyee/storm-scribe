This is an implementation of a spout that receives data from Scribe. It is an example of a "push spout", in that data is pushed to it rather than the spout pulling data from somewhere else.

This spout requires a fork of Scribe that allows for Zookeeper-based node discovery: https://github.com/traviscrawford/scribe

See http://groups.google.com/group/scribe-server/msg/c6d04c3b0ee25ddc for more details on how that works.

This is an unreliable spout that doesn't guarantee data processing. With some more work, it can be extended to be reliable â€“ see the note in ScribeReceiver.java.
